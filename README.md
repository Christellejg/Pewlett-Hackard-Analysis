# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
For this asssignment, I was tasked to analyze the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This analysis is to help prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees are reaching closer to their retirement age.


## Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
